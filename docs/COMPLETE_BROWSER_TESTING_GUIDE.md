## 🗄️ DATABASE VERIFICATION

### Check Rating Data in Database:
```sql
-- View all ratings
SELECT r.id, r.rating, r.feedback, u1.email as reviewer, u2.email as reviewed
FROM rating r
JOIN "user" u1 ON r.reviewer_id = u1.id
JOIN "user" u2 ON r.reviewed_id = u2.id
ORDER BY r.created_at DESC;

-- View rating statistics
SELECT 
    u.email,
    COUNT(r.id) as total_ratings,
    AVG(r.rating) as average_rating
FROM "user" u
LEFT JOIN rating r ON u.id = r.reviewed_id
WHERE u.role = 'escort'
GROUP BY u.id, u.email
ORDER BY average_rating DESC;
```

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If login doesn't work:
1. Check Flask console for errors
2. Verify database connection
3. Ensure test user exists: `testuser@example.com`

### If ratings don't submit:
1. Check browser developer tools for JavaScript errors
2. Verify CSRF protection is disabled for testing
3. Check Flask logs for POST request errors

### If database errors occur:
1. Ensure PostgreSQL container is running: `docker ps`
2. Verify migrations applied: Check rating table exists
3. Check data with SQL queries above
