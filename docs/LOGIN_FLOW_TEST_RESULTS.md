# Login Flow Test Results

## Test Summary
Date: July 3, 2025  
Time: 09:21 GMT

## Issue Resolution
**Problem**: After successful login, the application was redirecting to `/profile` instead of `/dashboard`.

**Root Cause**: There was an orphaned `@app.route('/profile', methods=['GET', 'POST'])` decorator in `app.py` at line 204 that had no function definition. This created a route conflict between the main app route and the blueprint route for `/profile`.

**Solution**: Removed the orphaned decorator from `app.py`.

## Test Results

### 2. Dashboard Access Test
